My Portofolio 27/10/2016
This is an E-learning Aid project, I built several years ago to assist students studying Wi-Fi, WiMAX and LTE(Long Term Evolution).  
Because all the link use address relative to the root directory, the project requires to be setup at the root directory of a web server, otherwise the site will not work.
